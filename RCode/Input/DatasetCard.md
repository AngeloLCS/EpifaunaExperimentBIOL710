## Project Title: 
The effects of seasonal fish communities on eelgrass (Zostera marina) bed health within the impacted San Francisco Bay Estuary 

### Description of dataset *epifauna*

*date* = day on which a run of experiments was completed
*tank* = tank identification, used to keep track of potential tank effects
*treatment* = species of fish predators singly and in pairs: Cymatogaster aggregata, Leptocottus armatus, Hypsopsetta guttulata, Pholis ornata, Paralichthys californicus
*gamm_loss* = loss of gammarid amphipods during experiment
*capr_loss* = loss of caprellid amphipods during experiment
*pent_loss* = loss of Pentidotea resecata during experiment
*fish1_mass* = weight of fish 1 in a replicate tank
*fish2_mass* = weight of fish 2 in a replicate tank
*fish_mass_tot* = total weight of fish in replicate tank
*tank_vol* = volume of tank
